# Comparative Genomic Analysis and Pangenome Calculation of an Emerging Pseudomonadaceae member, Thiopseudomonas alkaliphila

Thiopseudomonas alkaliphila, an organism recently classified within the Pseudomonadaceae family, has been detected in diverse sources such as human tissues, animal guts, industrial fermenters, and decomposition environments, suggesting a diverse ecological role. However, a large knowledge gap exists in how T. alkaliphila functions. In this comparative genomic analysis, variations indicative of adaptation to specific habitats with distinct clusters among strains are revealed, notably isolates from chicken intestines exhibit differences from human-derived strains. Pangenome investigation reveals a core metabolic utilization of multiple glucose catabolic pathways, suggesting adaptability to varied environments and carbon sources. The genomic repertoire of T. alkaliphila includes secondary metabolites, such as antimicrobials and siderophores, indicative of its involvement in microbial competition and resource acquisition. Additionally, the presence of prophages, plasmids, and CRISPR-Cas systems in T. alkaliphila genomes suggests mechanisms for horizontal gene transfer and defense against viral predation. This comprehensive genomic analysis expands our understanding on the functions and potential community dynamics of T. alkaliphila, while emphasizing T. alkaliphilaâ€™s adaptability and diverse capabilities across various ecosystems.
